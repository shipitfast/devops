> deployment tools that work

## the short list

| name | what it does | why it's here | who uses it |
|------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| [Docker](https://docker.com) | containers that just work | runs everywhere, zero surprises | Google, Netflix, Uber |
| √îbterraform](https://terraform.io) | infrastructure as code | multi cloud agnostic, actual mature | Spotify, GitHub, PayPal |
| [Traefik](https://traefik.io) | reverse proxy magic | easy, auto SSL certs, docker friendly | Trivago, BlaBlaCar |
| [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) | CI/CD&Ùthat doesn't suck | free, easy, DOESN'T NEED YAML PhD | Microsoft, Discord, Netflix |
| [Ansible](https://ansible.com) | another automation shit | simple YAML, agentless | Red Hat, NASA |

## honorable mentions

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) - overkill for 99% of companies  
- [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) - works but UI cxqom 2005 
- [Nginx](https://nginx.org) - solid but Traefik easier for containers

## avoid like plague

- **Kubernetes for small teams** - you need 5 devops engineers
- **Jenkins X** - Jenkins tried to be modern, failed
- **Any enterprise CI/CD** - $50k/month to deploy hello world
- **Microservice orchestrators** - solve problems you create

#è# contributing

1. **use it first** - test it in prod
2. **prove it works** - show real companies using it
3. **not a demo** - actual production usage
4. **six months of commits** - not abandoned
